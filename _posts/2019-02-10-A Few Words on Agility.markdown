A Boeing 747 flies at 900 km/h, while a small Embraer "Tucano" used for acrobatics by the Brazilian Air Force's smoke squadron flies at 300 km/h. Despite the Boeing being faster, it lacks the agility of a "Tucano." Agility is what allows for quick changes in direction and reactions to the surrounding conditions.

When taking off, a Boeing requires a rigorous flight plan and certainty about its destination. However, for maneuvers, the agility of a "Tucano" is more useful. When exploring uncharted paths, agility surpasses rigidity and speed. It allows for exploration to discover the best endpoint and explore shorter routes to reach the destination. It provides a competitive advantage compared to inflexible rigor and speed.

21st-century organizations seek agility in their initiatives. This article will explore the Agile Manifesto and practices that enable it to be applied to complex initiatives in any field. The practices discussed here are based on the Scrum framework, one of the most popular approaches for implementing agility.

## Before we begin, what are the premises?

### The 20th Century and the Premise of Predictability

"Questioning who should be the boss is like discussing who should be the saxophonist in a quartet: obviously, it's the one who knows how to play." - Henry Ford.

The 20th century evolved and solidified the practices of the industrial revolution. Practices applied in factories were disseminated to large structures and became a paradigm for organizing work: hierarchy, planning, and discipline.

Despite operating in complicated environments, factories aimed for predictability. A small group of specialists understood their operations and guided others in production work, emphasizing efficiency.

### The 21st Century and the New Premises: Complexity and Uncertainty

"We have no idea what your business or industry is, so we dare not tell you how to create a business plan. However, we can say with 100% certainty that if you have a plan, it is wrong." - Eric Schmidt; Jonathan Rosenberg, How Google Works.

The 20th-century factory model no longer meets the needs of a complex, competitive, and uncertain environment. Marketing managers are unsure if they are developing products that consumers want, technicians are uncertain about solution alternatives, and regulatory bodies are uncertain about social innovation consequences. Complexity and uncertainty are the new premises.

Approaches that fail to recognize uncertainty tend to create fantasies of anticipatory planning for unpredictable circumstances. They compromise work by constantly adjusting plans, wasting time and losing focus. Delays and failures are often attributed to individual incompetence and unexpected events. Organizations that fail to recognize uncertainty perpetuate the cycle of waste and delays.

Today, organizations worldwide strive to bring agility as an approach for delivering more assertive solutions on time in highly competitive, complex, and uncertain environments. This article explores a better approach based on the new premises.

## The Agile Manifesto

In the face of high project failure rates in software development projects, in 2001, a group of 17 experts rethought the approach to complex work. The result was summarized in values and principles that lead to a more assertive approach to delivering quality software in line with stakeholders' expectations.

The manifesto begins with the following value statement:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

Although the manifesto focuses on software, the above values are profound and have implications beyond information technology. According to Jeff Sutherland, one of the manifesto authors and creator of the Agile Scrum approach, these principles can be applied to any complex initiative.

By replacing the word "software" with "solution" and understanding the word "customer" as someone with a need to be met by the initiative, we have a broad reading of the application of these principles. Let's explore this further in this article.

## Exploring the Values of the Agile Manifesto

### 1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

The agile approach recognizes that knowledge comes from experience and decisions should be based on what is known. To learn from experience, the focus should be more on people than on processes and tools.

The study of the agile approach concluded that work is more productive when addressed by a team with the necessary knowledge to propose and execute solutions (multidisciplinary teams), self-managed teams, and teams that are small (up to 8 people) are recommended.

The agile approach came to address complex problems. Effective and efficient communication between stakeholders is crucial. This is why recurring interactions and preferably face-to-face communication are valued.

To adopt agility, it is important to have a work process that allows:

- Iterative progress: Proceed step-by-step, learning at each step.
- Learn and adapt by listening to customers as the work progresses.
- Work with small teams, favoring face-to-face interactions.
- Have a set of lightweight rules that allow the disciplined and cadenced empirical process to continue, as agility should contribute to meeting expectations within the expected time.

### 2. Working software over comprehensive documentation

The agile approach focuses on working solutions, delivering value, and meeting or exceeding customer and future user expectations.

The focus of work is on value deliveries, meaning something potentially usable. For the creation of an application, a valuable delivery could be a prototype for customer evaluation or the initial version for validation. If we are talking about the work of a law firm in drafting a complex contract, a draft for stakeholder review is a valuable delivery. In this context, it usually does not make sense to consider a schedule or a status report as a valuable delivery to the customer.

The agile approach considers:

- At the end of each iterative step, something potentially usable should be presented to the customer.
- Demonstrate and listen to customer feedback and suggestions to learn what works and adapt as necessary to meet the expected value.

### 3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

The agile approach recognizes that the initial understanding of a problem is a hypothesis that needs to be validated and adapted as more information becomes available. Collaboration with customers is essential for feedback, enabling adjustments and validating assumptions throughout the project.

Collaboration with the customer, if well conducted, can reduce time and cost compared to the frequent replanning common in traditional processes.

### 4. Responding to change over following a plan

The main differentiating factor of the agile approach is adaptability.

Following work iteratively, working with hypotheses, listening to the customer as parts of the solution are delivered, and making decisions based on what is known are characteristics of the agile approach that make it more capable of responding to change than following a rigid plan.

## Final Considerations

Regardless of the initiative, the agile approach will always rely on basic principles:

- A vision of what needs to be done, in detail for the nearest tasks and at a high level for the distant ones.
- Small, multidisciplinary, self-managed teams.
- Iterative work with a focus on delivering something potentially usable.
- Feedback as a critical tool, listening to the customer throughout the iterations.
- Adaptability, having the courage to admit necessary changes to maintain the expected value of the deliveries.

By understanding the motivations behind the values of the Agile Manifesto and using a framework with basic work rules, it is possible to organize work in a way that addresses agility and generates more value for individuals and organizations.

In 2001, a group of experts rethought the approach to complex work in response to high project failure rates in software development. The result was the Agile Manifesto, which outlines values and principles for delivering quality software that meets stakeholder expectations.

The manifesto emphasizes the following values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

While initially focused on software, these values have broader implications across various fields. They can be applied to any complex initiative to drive success.

## Exploring the Values of the Agile Manifesto

### 1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

The agile approach recognizes that knowledge comes from experience and decisions should be based on this knowledge. It prioritizes the critical role of individuals in evaluating and iterating on solutions, emphasizing collaboration and interaction.

### 2. Working software over comprehensive documentation

Agile values delivering working solutions that provide value and meet or exceed customer expectations. While documentation is important, it is secondary to functional software that can be utilized and evaluated by customers.

### 3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Agile recognizes that the initial understanding of a problem is a hypothesis that must be validated and adapted as more information becomes available. Collaboration with customers is crucial for feedback, enabling adjustments and validating assumptions throughout the project.

### 4. Responding to change over following a plan

Agile embraces adaptability as a key differentiator. It emphasizes iterative progress, working with hypotheses, listening to customers, and making decisions based on evolving knowledge. This flexibility allows agile teams to respond effectively to changes and evolving requirements.

## Final Considerations

Regardless of the initiative, agility relies on fundamental principles:

- A clear vision of the work, with detailed plans for the immediate future and high-level plans for the long term.
- Small, multidisciplinary, self-managed teams.
- Iterative work focused on delivering potentially usable increments of value.
- Continuous feedback from customers, driving learning and adaptation.
- Adaptability, the willingness to make necessary changes to maintain the expected value of deliverables.

By understanding the motivations behind the Agile Manifesto and applying a framework with disciplined and flexible work practices, organizations can embrace agility and generate greater value for individuals and the organization as a whole.
