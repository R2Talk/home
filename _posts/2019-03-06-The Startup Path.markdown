The success of unicorn startups, those that surpass a market value of $1 billion, has raised a red flag for large traditional corporations. Besides their impressive exponential growth, companies like Uber, Airbnb, WeWork, IFood, and Rappi are reshaping the market and transforming business models, many of which were previously under the control of large traditional companies.

For several years, these large companies have been wondering how they can adopt the working methods of startups and remain competitive in terms of business innovation. In other words, how can they create unicorns within their own domains, considering options like internal transformation, partnerships, and acquisitions?

Despite their intentions, corporations need to deal with the fact that their management is geared toward maintaining the status quo. They are risk-averse and seek to invest in projects that have a "convincing" demonstration of return on investment (ROI).

The issue for large corporations regarding risks is directly related to scale. A problem generated by a project can affect millions of consumers, and an investment error can lead to immense losses. In startups, on the other hand, risk is inherent, and scale is usually addressed after the success of an initial launch with a manageable number of customers. This environment allows for experimentation and changes.

## How can we reconcile the values of such different contexts and cultures?

Let's consider some key insights inspired by Eric Ries' publications, "The Lean Startup" and "The Startup Way," both of which are strong references for transformation alternatives.

### Phased Implementation and Executive Sponsorship

The traditional company is focused on scale, operations, and risk management. They lack experience in the startup style.

Recognizing that lean initiatives have an empirical bias, it is not advisable to try to change the company in a big bang motion. Instead, it is recommended to go through phases that allow for learning and the formation of a new culture.

The first phase requires strong executive sponsorship and the creation of initiatives that will operate outside the company's usual standards.

These initiatives must be protected from institutional constraints and have exceptions to the rules.

The exceptions should be managed together with areas traditionally focused on controls and constraints, such as regulatory, financial, and quality control departments.

Exceptions do not mean relinquishing responsibilities; they simply allow for flexibility to assess risks and make decisions that align with the initiative and are not constrained by current policies. Examples include relaxing supplier selection, financing the initiative even without traditional business plans, etc.

Once the initial initiatives prove themselves, the following phases will follow the path of institutionalization. Rules that were broken in the first phase are reviewed to systematize them and eventually lead the entire company to the new model.

### Metrics

The startup style requires initiatives to start with trend metrics (customer engagement, solution adoption or abandonment rates, conversion rates, etc.), rather than traditional outcome metrics (ROI, revenue, market share, etc.).

Traditional metrics can prematurely cancel startup-style initiatives and should only be used when the solution is on its way to scaling.

Initiatives should rely on actionable metrics that show cause-and-effect relationships, enabling the evaluation of assumptions and decision-making on what to change and maintain to achieve the vision. They should enable the "build-measure-learn" cycle.

### Budgeting

Many startups secure investment based on their initial vision, potential for exponential growth, and convincing founders.

To survive, founders need to show positive trend indicators that demonstrate the idea is on the right track. Based on these indicators, they can secure further investment to move forward towards profitability, or they may fail.

Companies need to draw inspiration from this model and have an "investor mindset" to finance and monitor startup-style initiatives.

Investment decisions should not be based solely on a clearly demonstrated ROI in traditional business plans, but on the vision, potential, and team. Progress should be rigorously measured through trend indicators, and investment decisions should be reevaluated on a recurring basis.

### Dedicated Teams

Traditionally, companies divide their employees' attention among multiple initiatives and routine activities. Although not impossible to work that way, the dedication of small teams is a critical success factor.

### Exploring Hypotheses with MVPs

The vision of a startup-style initiative is supported by assumptions and hypotheses about the market and customers. These hypotheses should be tested with cause-and-effect metrics directly with customers.

Involving customers with product versions that allow testing of hypotheses (Minimum Viable Products or MVPs) before investing further in a product or service that proves to have incorrect assumptions.

Learning and changing the product without changing the vision (pivot) to increase the chances of success.

It is essential to highlight that the purpose of an MVP is not merely to reach the market faster. The main function of an MVP is to test assumptions and learn from customer feedback.

### Coaching

People need training, support, and guidance for this new challenge. Coaches are responsible for accompanying, explaining, and helping individuals adapt to the new way of working.

Coaches do not necessarily have to be external individuals. Preparing internal coaches has the advantage that they understand the company's reality.

### Entrepreneurship Leadership

As the new culture progresses, internal entrepreneurship should be encouraged, and initiatives should be formally monitored.

Having an executive with this focus is beneficial because it reinforces institutionalization and represents the balancing side that must balance operations and routines.

Well, for now, we'll stop here. Stay tuned for future articles on startups, agility, and aspects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
